            <p>Mushroom compost, or substrate, is the soil-like material remaining after a crop of mushrooms and is high in organic matter making it desirable for use as a soil amendment or soil conditioner.

              Once the final crop of mushrooms has been harvested, the spent substrate is removed from the mushroom growing beds. Research has shown the material retains nutrients and other qualities that make it an ideal crop production and landscaping component. Marketed as Mushroom Compost, it is rich in organic matter and has high value for conifer tree production, turf grass managers and landscape contractors. </p>

              “Recently, the US Federal government banned online casinos from operating in America by
              making it illegal to
              transfer money to them through any US bank or payment system. As a result of this law, most
              of the popular
              online casino networks such as Party Gaming and PlayTech left the United States. Overnight,

              players found themselves being chased by the Federal government. But, after a fortnight, the
              online casino
              industry came up with a solution and new online casinos started taking root. These began to
              operate under a
